## A. Abstract

## B. Introduction

## C. Methods Of Redesign

### Base
#### Original Design: 

◉ The base had a standard height and minimal structural supports.

#### Altered Design:

◉ The height was increased to improve overall stability.

◉ Additional structural supports were integrated into the baseplate to enhance strength and ensure better load-bearing capacity.

### Gripper Part 1
#### Original Design: 

◉ The gripper was designed with a central diameter for basic functionality.

#### Altered Design:

◉ The central diameter was reduced to minimize weight and compact the design.

◉ Additional teeth were added around the perimeter to enhance grip and mechanical engagement.

◉ Enhanced aesthetics and mechanical efficiency.

### Gripper Part 3
#### Original Design:

◉ Dual-arm gripper design.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Simplified design with fewer parts for easier assembly.

◉ Transitioned to a single curved component, enabling a wider range of motion and potentially new applications like sweeping or rotating tasks.

### Gripper Part 4
#### Original Design:

◉ The gripper was composed of multiple arms for gripping functionality.

#### Altered Design:

◉ A handle was added to the design for improved ergonomics.

◉ Text engraving was included for labeling purposes.

◉ Slight shape changes were implemented for a more refined appearance.

### Gripper Part 5
#### Original Design:

◉  A functional design without any specific ergonomic features.

#### Altered Design:

◉ A rectangular handle was added to improve user interaction.

◉ Engraved text was included for clarity and usability.

◉ Minor refinements were made to enhance the design’s aesthetics and usability.

### Sensor Plate
#### Original Design:

◉ Included basic slots and cutouts.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Slots and cutouts were repositioned and reshaped for better uniformity and ease of manufacturing.

### Lid
#### Original Design:

◉ A thin section surrounding the screw hole.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Reinforced with increased thickness for greater durability and resistance to stress.

### Connector Part 2
#### Original Design:

◉ Limited stability with fewer reinforcement holes.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Additional holes were added to improve stability and secure connections during motor operations.

### Connector Part 3
#### Original Design:

◉ Similar to Connector Part 2, with minimal reinforcement.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Similar improvements were made, with additional holes for enhanced stability and durability.

### Modular
#### Original Design:

◉ Standard screw holes with minimal reinforcement.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Screw holes were thickened to reinforce the structure and improve durability.

◉ Adjustments were made to prevent breakage during assembly.

### Base Plate
#### Original Design:

◉ A plain surface with no additional stability features.

#### Altered Design:

◉ A keyhole feature was added to enhance stability and prevent movement during motor operations.

### Joint 2
#### Original Design:

◉ Basic screw holes with limited support.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Screw holes were thickened and repositioned for better durability and assembly stability.

◉ Additional support was added around the screw holes to prevent breakage.

◉ Deeper holes were implemented to ensure a secure and clean assembly.

### Joint 3
#### Original Design:

◉ Basic frame and support structure.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Screw holes were thickened for improved durability.

◉ Deeper holes were added to ensure a cleaner fit and prevent screws from sticking out.

### Joint 4
#### Original Design:

◉ Standard screw hole structure.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Screw holes were thickened to prevent breakage and ensure greater durability.

### Joint 5
#### Original Design:

◉ Basic screw holes with minimal reinforcement.

#### Altered Design:

◉ The screw holes were thickened for added durability.

◉ Additional support was incorporated around the screw holes to prevent breakage during operation.

### Joint 6
#### Original Design:

◉ Basic screw hole design with limited stability.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Screw holes were thickened and repositioned for enhanced durability.

◉ Additional support was added to ensure greater stability during motor operations.
