## A. Abstract

## B. Introduction

## C. Methods Of Redesign

### Base
#### Original Design: 

◉ The base had a standard height and minimal structural supports.

#### Altered Design:

◉ The height was increased to improve overall stability.

◉ Additional structural supports were integrated into the baseplate to enhance strength and ensure better load-bearing capacity.

### Gripper Part 1
#### Original Design: 

◉ The gripper was designed with a central diameter for basic functionality.

#### Altered Design:

◉ The central diameter was reduced to minimize weight and compact the design.

◉ Additional teeth were added around the perimeter to enhance grip and mechanical engagement.

### Gripper Part 2
#### Original Design: 

◉ A basic gripper design with limited angular reach.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Improved functionality for rotational or grabbing tasks, allowing better angular reach and smoother engagement.

◉ Enhanced aesthetics and mechanical efficiency.

### Gripper Part 3
#### Original Design:

◉ Dual-arm gripper design.

#### Altered Design:

◉ Simplified design with fewer parts for easier assembly.

◉ Transitioned to a single curved component, enabling a wider range of motion and potentially new applications like sweeping or rotating tasks.

### Gripper Part 4
#### Original Design:

◉ The gripper was composed of multiple arms for gripping functionality.

#### Altered Design:

◉ A handle was added to the design for improved ergonomics.

◉ Text engraving was included for labeling purposes.

◉ Slight shape changes were implemented for a more refined appearance.

### Gripper Part 5
#### Original Design:

◉  A functional design without any specific ergonomic features.

#### Altered Design:

◉ A rectangular handle was added to improve user interaction.

◉ Engraved text was included for clarity and usability.

◉ Minor refinements were made to enhance the design’s aesthetics and usability.
