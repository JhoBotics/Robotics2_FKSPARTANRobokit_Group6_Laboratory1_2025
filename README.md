## A. Abstract

## B. Introduction

## C. Methods Of Redesign

### Base
#### Original Design: 

◉ The base had a standard height and minimal structural supports.

#### Altered Design:

◉ The height was increased to improve overall stability.

◉ Additional structural supports were integrated into the baseplate to enhance strength and ensure better load-bearing capacity.
